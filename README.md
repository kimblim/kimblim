# Hi, I'm Kim Johannesen and I like to design and build accessible, usable and performant websites and applications.
My current role is that of Design Manager at Workday, where I manage the Design Systems team, that works on _Workday Peakon Employee Voice_. Before that I co-founded and managed a small frontend consultancy in Copenhagen, [Shift](https://shift.dk), which was shut down in June of 2021. 
Previously I've held positions as frontend developer and design director.

## Approach
My approach is pretty much the same as [one of the design principles of HTML](https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies): In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity.

## HTML, CSS and Javascript
I have a wide variety of skills, but I primarily dabble in what I like to call *The Holy Trinity* of web development: HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

## Before my current role I did a bit of freelancing â€” among other things I...
* helped make sure that the new Danish national log-in system for businesses, MitID Erhverv, is WCAG compliant. 
* built the frontend for a national newspaper's website and their newsletter platform.
* helped create a few component libraries and design systems for clients. For those I've been using either [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) or [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

...but more than anything, I've used my experience to ask the right questions in order for the end product to help the users, whether those are "real" end users or developers and designers within an organisation.

## Speaking
Every now and then I give talks at conferences or events, mostly centered around accessibility and/or frontend development.

## Find me elsewhere
~I spend quite a bit of time on twitter, either on my personal (and Danish) profile, [@therealkimblim](https://twitter.com/therealkimblim), or on my "developer" account, [@overflowhidden](https://twitter.com/overflowhidden), where I ramble about accessibility, web standards and other stuff that relates to web development.~

Like a lot of people I've moved over to Mastodon, where you can find me at [@therealkimblim](https://mastodon.coffee/@therealkimblim).
