# Hi, I'm Kim Johannesen and I help companies and organisations build accessible, usable and performant websites and applications.
I'm currently managing director of a small frontend consultancy in Copenhagen called [Shift](https://shiftcph.dk). Previously I've held positions as frontend developer and design director.

## Approach
My approach is pretty much the same as [one of the design principles of HTML](https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies): In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity.

## HTML, CSS and Javascript
I have a wide variety of skills, but I primarily dabble in what I like to call *The Holy Trinity* of web development: HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Recently I've...
...created a few component libraries and design systems for clients. For those I've been using either [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) or [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), but more than anything, I've used my experience to ask the right questions in order for the end product to help the users, whether those are "real" end users or developers and designers within an organisation.

## Speaking
Every now and then I give talks at conferences or events, mostly centered around accessibility and/or frontend development.

## Find me elsewhere
Mostly I'm on a twitter, either on my personal (and Danish) profile, [@therealkimblim](https://twitter.com/therealkimblim), or on my "developer" account, [@overflowhidden](https://twitter.com/overflowhidden), where I ramble about accessibility, web standards and other stuff that relates to web development.
